# How Things Work 📕
## 1. Camera Control 🎥
<p> We all know that isometric is a technique of presenting 3D objects through second dimension, this study provides a basic camera with the ablitity to spin 90 degree, zoom and follow the player:</p>
<ul>
  <li> To spin the camera use <strong>Q & E</strong></li>
  <li> To zoom the camera, you can <strong>scroll the middle mouse button</strong>, or <strong>hold Z to zoom in</strong> and <strong>hold X to zoom out</strong> </li>
  <li> To let the camera follow the player, just simply move the player anywhere you want using right mouse click</li>
</ul>

## 2. Mouse Control 🖱️
<p> Most isometric video games (especially RPGs, RTSs and MOBAs) use mouse to control players and objects. Thus, this study provides: </p>
<ul>
  <li> 🖱️ <strong>Click to move</strong> 🏃‍♂️: Using right mouse button, when clicking on any position of the ground layer, the player will move to that position. </li>
  <li> 🖱️ <strong>Click to interact</strong> 🤏: Using left mouse button to interact with objects. </li>
  <li><i>(right now the code for this only get the name of the object when clicked. If you want to improve it, it's your choice.)</i></li>
</ul>

# Using The Assets 🖥️
<p> To apply my study to your project, drag all the stuffs of the this study's Assets folder to yours. Make sure to rearrage, or else it would be a mass chaos 📁</p>

# Contribution 🤝
<p> With warm welcome from me when you can help to improve this study with more logics and graphics 💗</p>
